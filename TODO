Future Enhancements
-------------------

systemd support
  - Support receiving unix sockets from systemd.
  - Make daemonize() do what's right for systemd.
  - Can we auto-detect systemd?  Maybe the presence of the environment vars
    for the unix sockets?

Look into using libnl for netlink
  - Can this be done?

DBUS support
Re-add ancillary files needed for wider distribution
Add a main config file
 - support multiple event sources (such as named pipes)
Allow socket-connected clients to filter incoming events
