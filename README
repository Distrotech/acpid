acpid for netlink

This is Ted Felix's <http://www.tedfelix.com> branch of the acpid project 
which includes support for netlink and the input layer.

/proc/acpi/event is a deprecated kernel interface for ACPI events.  Newer
kernels rely on netlink and the input layer to send ACPI-related events.
This branch of acpid uses these new interfaces.

Any comments or patches for this branch should be sent to Ted Felix:

Overview
--------

  ACPID used to try to handle events internally.  Rather than try to climb
  an ever-growing mountain, ACPID now lets YOU define what events to handle.
  Any event that publishes itself to /proc/acpi/event can be handled.

  ACPID reads a set of configuration files which define event->action pairs.
  This is how you make it do stuff. See the man page for details.

Implementation status
---------------------

  This version should have complete support for generic handling of events.

Requirements
------------

  For 2.6 and newer 2.4 kernels, ACPI seems to be fully integrated.  That
  should be all you need.

  The ACPI kernel driver should be working on your system before trying
  ACPID.  Verify ACPI is loaded by verifying the existence of
  /proc/acpi/event.

Compiling ACPID
---------------

  type "make"
